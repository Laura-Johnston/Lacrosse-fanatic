  <h2 class="newToLacrosse">New to Lacrosse?</h2>
  <p>No problem. </br> Lacrosse is a team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball, both pictured above. Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has four
versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: </br></p>
<strong><p class="typesOfLacrosse">Field lacrosse, Women's lacrosse, Box lacrosse and Intercrosse.</p> </strong>
<p>
The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players
wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads.The women's game is played outdoors and does not
allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact.The only protective gear required for women players is
eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors
that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.</br></br>
